Steps:

1. get users permission.
now this data will be attached to the app's service worker.
Hence it does not change.

Notification.requestPermission( status => { } )

2. Check if u have the permission 
Notification.permission === 'granted'

3. SHow the Notification
Notifications are shown on the registered service worker.
So u need to get hand over the registered service worker and then on the registration object, call showNotification()
navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistration().then( reg => {
            console.log( reg );
            reg.showNotification( 'Hello world', {
                body: 'This is testing',
                vibrate: [200,100,200,100],
                tag: "vibration"
            })
        })

if (permission === "granted") {
        var notification = new Notification("Hi there!"); // without serviceWorker
      }

Notification.permission Read only
A string representing the current permission to display notifications. Possible values are:
denied — The user refuses to have notifications displayed.
granted — The user accepts having notifications displayed.
default — The user choice is unknown and therefore the browser will act as if the value were denied.

4. User interaction





Notification.requestPermission( status => {


    if( Notification.permission === 'granted' ){
        navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistration().then( reg => {
            console.log( reg );
            reg.showNotification( 'Hello world', {
                body: 'This is testing',
                vibrate: [200,100,200,100],
                tag: "vibration",
                data: {name:"sp",age:53},
                image: "/images/android-icon-192x192.png",
                icon: "/images/android-icon-192x192.png",
                actions: [
                    {
                        action: "click", title: "click", icon: "/images/android-icon-192x192.png"
                    },
                    {
                        action: "close", title: "close", icon: "/images/android-icon-192x192.png"
                    },
                    {
                        action: "open", title: "open", icon: "/images/android-icon-192x192.png"
                    }
                ]
            })
        })
    }
})

// atmost u can add many actions but only two will be show.
// each action must have action,title and icon

// all the actions will be heard in sw "notificationclick" event.
// filter the action value to decide.
